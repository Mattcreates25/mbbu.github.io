“Coding has always fascinated me. Being from an Applied Bioengineering (genomics-based) background, I was actively looking for a bridge between the two. The internship provided an opportunity to learn and polish my programming skills under guidance and see its application in multi-omics data processing using real-life problems. Moreover, it cultivated a self-learning discipline that has played a key role in continuously solidifying and expanding my Bioinformatics knowledge. The skills and experience gained during the internship gave me a competitive advantage when applying for Bioinformatics opportunities hence paving the way to getting the EANBiT master’s fellowship. The internship increased my resilience and self-discipline which still plays a key role in my MSc Bioinformatics journey.”
