Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean

Coding has always fascinated me. Being from an Applied Bioengineering (genomics-based) background, I was actively looking for a bridge between the two. The internship provided an opportunity to learn and polish my programming skills under guidance and see its application in multi-omics data processing using real-life problems. Moreover, it cultivated a self-learning discipline that has played a key role in continuously solidifying and expanding my Bioinformatics knowledge. The skills and experience gained during the internship gave me a competitive advantage when applying for Bioinformatics opportunities hence paving the way to getting the EANBiT master’s fellowship. The internship increased my resilience and self-discipline which still plays a key role in my MSc Bioinformatics journey.

The internship training demystified my career path in bioinformatics. The introduction to Python programming skills, Linux, R, and Data analysis skills, and collaborative mini-project on RNASeq motivated me to enroll in short courses in Bioinformatics such as the NGS training by H3BioNet after the internship. Additionally, I got to interact with experts in the field through the Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya. My quest to acquire more skills kept me on my toes as I sought to advance my skills to a Master's level. Following highly competitive interviews, I emerged as one of the beneficiaries of the EANBiT fellowship. I am grateful for the support towards achieving my career goal. I look forward to sharing my experiences with the upcoming Bioinformaticians.

### Even More Farther

The internship opportunity laid a foundation for my current career in Bioinformatics. It was designed to equip me with Bioinformatics skills. I got to learn programming languages such as Python and R, Introduction to Biological databases. It helped me improve my communication skills through journal presentations and project progress meetings. I was privileged to collaborate on a mini-project, where I got to put the gained skills into practice through real-time analysis of data. The four months of exposure and mentorship turned me into a Bioinformatics enthusiast and stirred my interest even more to become an authority in the field of Bioinformatics. This led to my application and acceptance as an EANBiT masters fellow

With substantial skills in programming, the Internship served as a platform for me to reconcile my knowledge in Molecular Biology and Computing skills. The introductory training on the concepts of bioinformatics was key in putting my career vision into a clear perspective. It was from the internship program that I established that my interests were more aligned to building software involved in bioinformatics research. From the internship, I learned one key lesson, no single person ever has all the answers to a problem and it’s only by working together and appreciating the different perspectives and ideologies others bring to the table that we get to put the whole big picture together. Currently, I am pursuing my MSc in Bioinformatics, with the hope of eventually fulfilling my long-term vision of becoming a Bioinformatics engineer, a career path and vision I only got to establish during my time as an intern.

## Nelly Wambui

My name is Nelly Wambui. A friend of mine encouraged me to apply for the internship as it was quite helpful to her growth as an upcoming scientist. The moment I became a bioinformatics intern I felt like a fish in new waters, capable to swim, but we do feel a bit lost in new places, right? The mentors gave us so much guidance and in the end I not only grew in my bioinformatics skills but also in finding a clear career path. The internship was engaging  through the various mini-projects and trainings that helped us know what bioinformatics really entails. 

In the four months I interned at ICIPE, I gained bioinformatics, planning, presentation and communication skills. The bioinformatics skills made me confident in making applications for bioinformatics job opportunities and scholarships. The planning skills helped me know the importance of having a good schedule for my work to ensure I complete my tasks in good time and in a well done manner. The presentation and communication skills I got from each code review and journal club meeting built my courage in speaking in front of people and I learnt how to make my presentations clear and to the point.  

I developed more love for bioinformatics as part of the internship and was therefore sure I would love to do a Masters in Bioinformatics. I have been well mentored by our internship supervisors, even after the four months. Whenever I required a mock interview for a job opportunity they have been available to guide me and I am grateful for having them. It was a wholesome experience that did more than encourage me to be a better person in science. Apart from that, it opened me up to a world of endless opportunities in coding to earn.  

I am grateful to have been part of the cohort 4 interns. I do hope that more and more people get to pass through the great team of bioinformaticians at ICIPE and afterwards find themselves in great bioinformatics and genomic science roles in the scientific community.
