participants:
  - name: Rose Wambui
    photo: /assets/img/cohorts/cohort_two/rose_wambui.jpg
    course: Bachelor of Science Medical Biology and Chemistry
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: The incubation program focused on specific topics and allowed me to explore on areas in Bioinformactics I wanted to focus on. My expectations for the program was to analyse and understand Genomic data and this was possible through the Accredited Program, where we worked in a collaborative environment to tackle data in realtime. The program is flexible and Dr Caleb Kibet has been a mentor and has been providing major support towards my future.

  - name: Simeon Hebrew

    course: Bachelor of Science Bio Chemistry and Molecular Biology
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation program offered a well-detailed introduction to Bioinformatics. Our supervisors Dr. Caleb Kibet and Festus Nyasimi guided us through various problem solving strategies, they were also willing to help if I had any issues with the tasks that I undertook. Joining the program allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of Bioinformatics and as a result, I have started to form a clear outline of what field I want to be in.

  - name: Christine Abura Asatsa

    course: Bachelor of Science Marine Biology
    university: Pwani University
    description: I took on the Bioinformatics mentorship program to bridge the gap of data between Environmental science and Bioinformatics. The program so far has been mindblowing i have interacted with various programs such as Python, Basher and R. Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be a challenge, but Dr Caleb Kibet and Festus Nyasimi were able to provide support during the tough times andtherefore I was able to catup with the tasks and projects very fast.

  - name: Kauthar Omar

    course: Bachelor of Science Applied BioEngineering
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: My goal joining the Bioinformatics program was to explore what the mentorship entails and ynderstand programming languages. The learning curve has been good, resources are readily available, the structure of the courses contribute to each other and go hand in hand with my undergraduate Degree in Applied BioEngineering. I would like to thank Dr. Caleb Kibet and Festus Nyasimi for proving real time projects through the Accreditation program to help us prepare for real life data handling.

  - name: Wilson Mudaki

    course: Bachelor of Science Molecular Biology
    university: Kenyatta University
    description: Bioinformatics in Kenya is not well understood, The EANBiT program has exposed me to various Bioinformatics areas in computational biology and the biology aspect in Bioinformatics. Through the Bioinformatics Incubation program we have been able to work collaboratively to translate bioinformatics in real life situation, data in Kenya is huge and is yet to be handled and with the sudden adoption of innovation and technology this would now be easier to access, manage and monitor.
