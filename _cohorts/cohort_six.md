    description: I enjoyed my stay at icipe and thanks to the MBBU unit. The bioinformatics internship was intensive, but I enjoyed learning from the generous facilitators who were always ready and willing to help at any time. You also meet friendly scientists from diverse disciplines.  The internship is a perfect program for any undergrad aspiring to pursue a career in bioinformatics despite their background studies. The internship program helped me build confidence in furthering my studies in bioinformatics to the graduate level. Although I will miss my life at icipe, I am happy that I have developed a good network of mentors with similar interests.

    description: “You do not get what you want; you get what you go for”. This four-month training program at icipe has been a journey of great transformation and growth, courtesy of the wonderful trainers; Dr. Caleb Kibet, Ms. Ruth Nanjala as well as Mr. Nehemiah Ongeso. This coupled with the state-of-the-art facilities at icipe and collaboration between ourselves has made this training very transformative and impactful. This training opened my mind and enabled me to broadly understand bioinformatics and appreciate its roles and applications to other Science disciplines. As a Health-Science research enthusiast, this program helped me to answer the question “why bioinformatics?” and has really streamlined my career path and vision. Interestingly, the program enabled me to “learn how to learn”. The mentorship part of the program has been very enlightening and has prepared me professionally to be who I want to be. Moreover, this was an excellent opportunity to interact, share our different ideas and learn from the like-minded teams at icipe.

projects:
  - name: Metabarcoding-of-Rumen-Microbiome
    description: This Project aims to establish rumen microbiome diversity and variation between cattle, camels, goats and sheep. Genomic rumen microbiome DNA was isolated and characterized using bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA, protozoal 18S rRNA genes and fungal ITS1 gene amplicons sequencing from the harvested bovine rumen fluid samples using next-generation sequencing technology.
