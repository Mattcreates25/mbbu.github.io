    description: I enjoyed my stay at icipe and am grateful to the MBBU unit. The bioinformatics internship was intensive, but I enjoyed learning from the generous facilitators, who were always ready and willing to help at any time. You also meet friendly scientists from diverse disciplines. The internship is a perfect program for any undergrad aspiring to pursue a career in bioinformatics, despite their background studies. The internship program helped me build confidence in furthering my studies in bioinformatics to the graduate level. Although I will miss my life at icipe, I am happy that I have developed a good network of mentors with similar interests.

    description: The bioinformatics internship at icipe provides a wholesome experience of what it takes to be a great scientist. The training taught me not to be myopic in my thinking and that where there is a will, there’s a way. I have learned how to collaborate with others and open my mind to different perspectives. This internship changes your thinking and equips you with various tools to solve different bioinformatics problems. I am grateful for this opportunity because it has set the pace for everything else I will do in science.

    course: Bachelor of Science Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: “You do not get what you want; you get what you go for.” This four-month training program at icipe has been a journey of great transformation and growth, courtesy of the outstanding trainers; Dr. Caleb Kibet, Ms. Ruth Nanjala, and Mr. Nehemiah Ongeso. The state-of-the-art facilities at icipe and the collaboration between interns made the training very transformative and impactful. The training opened my mind and enabled me to broadly understand bioinformatics and appreciate its roles and applications to other science disciplines. As a health-science research enthusiast, the program helped me answer the question “Why bioinformatics?” and has streamlined my career path and vision. Interestingly, the program enabled me to “learn how to learn." The mentorship part of the program has been very enlightening and has prepared me professionally to be who I want to be. Moreover, this was an excellent opportunity to interact, share our different ideas, and learn from the like-minded teams at icipe.

projects:
  - name: Metabarcoding-of-Rumen-Microbiome
    description: This Project aims to establish rumen microbiome diversity and variation between cattle, camels, goats and sheep. Genomic rumen microbiome DNA was isolated and characterized using bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA, protozoal 18S rRNA genes and fungal ITS1 gene amplicons sequencing from the harvested bovine rumen fluid samples using next-generation sequencing technology.
