    course: Bachelor of Science Medical Biochemistry
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology
    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program was a huge turning point in my career. First, I gained technical skills in programming and genomics as well as professional skills including communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership. Second, it helped me establish my career path by enabling me to identify my strengths and build on them in order to carve out a niche for myself within the broad line of science. The program was successful owing to the student-centered approach in delivery of the curriculum, and the rounded support from the bioinformatics group at icipe led by Dr. Caleb Kibet. I appreciate Ruth Nanjala, the lead trainer, for her quality and skillful teaching, as well as the postgraduate students who also made a significant contribution to our learning. Last but not least, the peer mentorship that carries on even after the internship has ended has helped me broaden my professional network in the field of bioinformatics. This program is a great opportunity to learn, experience and network.

    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program at icipe is a major highlight in my career so far. Through it's very able and talented team of  facilitators led by Dr Caleb Kibet, the programme helped me improve in key areas that are essential in the field of Bioinformatics and Science in general. The practical application of acquired skills to solve real word problems went a long way to lay a strong foundation upon which to build a career in Bioinformatics. The programme also gave a boost to my confidence in my skills bearing in mind that we were learning from the best Scholars and Scientists. Overall, at the end of the internship, I was better at professional and scientific communication, Machine Learning, data analysis and most importantly had a broader network.
