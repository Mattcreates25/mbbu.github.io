    course: Bachelor of Science Medical Biochemistry
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology
    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program was a huge turning point in my career. First, I gained technical skills in programming and genomics as well as professional skills including communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership. Second, it helped me establish my career path by enabling me to identify my strengths and build on them in order to carve out a niche for myself within the broad line of science. The program was successful owing to the student-centered approach in delivery of the curriculum, and the rounded support from the bioinformatics group at icipe led by Dr. Caleb Kibet. I appreciate Ruth Nanjala, the lead trainer, for her quality and skillful teaching, as well as the postgraduate students who also made a significant contribution to our learning. Last but not least, the peer mentorship that carries on even after the internship has ended has helped me broaden my professional network in the field of bioinformatics. This program is a great opportunity to learn, experience and network.

    course: Bachelor of Science Applied Bioengineering
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology
    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program at icipe is a major highlight in my career so far. Through it's very able and talented team of  facilitators led by Dr Caleb Kibet, the programme helped me improve in key areas that are essential in the field of Bioinformatics and Science in general. The practical application of acquired skills to solve real word problems went a long way to lay a strong foundation upon which to build a career in Bioinformatics. The programme also gave a boost to my confidence in my skills bearing in mind that we were learning from the best Scholars and Scientists. Overall, at the end of the internship, I was better at professional and scientific communication, Machine Learning, data analysis and most importantly had a broader network.

    description: The Bioinformatics incubation program provides the much needed platform to kickstart a career in genomics research. Through the well curated programs, I discovered the various opportunities in Bioinformatics. I up-skilled in both hard and soft skills including programming, technical writing, mentorship and presentation skills. Iâ€™d like to thank Dr Caleb Kibet, Ruth Nanjala and the entire team for their mentorship in ensuring we become the best version of ourselves.

projects:
  - name: Reviewing 16s Analysis workflows
    description: This mini-project aims to review existing microbiome workflows, identify great ones and extend the workflows where there are gaps, especially to make them useful in insect and pathogen data.

  - name: Insect identification using deep learning
    description: The international centre of insect physiology and ecology is a leading institution in insect research in Africa and the world. There are several reasons why icipe focuses on insect research. These reasons include they are a source of food and feed, they are the most diverse and abundant forms of life on earth, and they are crop pests and disease vectors. There is a need to harness the potential of insects for food and feed, pest, disease vectors etc. and develop appropriate strategies e.g. control, industrialization and research. All these starts with identifying the insects, which is a role taken up by a well-trained entomologist. However, since entomologists are few and not always available, and insects varieties are many, raises the need for other automated techniques. Machine learning approaches, especially deep learning have become a go-to tool for automated image identification and classification. These digital solutions can be deployed on mobile phones and used by farmers and communities at large for image identification and classifiation.
