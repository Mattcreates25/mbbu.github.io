    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program was a huge turning point in my career. First, I gained technical skills in programming and genomics as well as professional skills including communication, presentation, teamwork and leadership. Second, it helped me establish my career path by enabling me to identify my strengths and build on them in order to carve out a niche for myself within the broad line of science. The program was successful owing to the student-centered approach in delivery of the curriculum, and the rounded support from the bioinformatics group at icipe led by Dr. Caleb Kibet. I appreciate Ruth Nanjala, the lead trainer, for her quality and skillful teaching, as well as the postgraduate students who also made a significant contribution to our learning. Last but not least, the peer mentorship that carries on even after the internship has ended has helped me broaden my professional network in the field of bioinformatics. This program is a great opportunity to learn, experience and network.

  - name: Black soldier fly ribosomal RNA analysis
    description: The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens, BSF) is a useful tool in valorising organic biomass and other biodegradable wastes. In this study, the BSF larvae were bred under different diets selected based on increasing lignocellulose content. These diets were processed chicken feed (CF), chicken manure (CM), Brewerâ€™s spent grain (BSG), and Water Hyacinth (WH). An additional diet Feed Mix (FM), consisting of the four diets in equal proportions was also incorporated. The different metatranscriptomes were sequenced using the PCR-cDNA approach on the ONT MinION platform. While the work, using ONT, aimed to identify and functionally characterise lignocellulosic biomass-degrading microbes, the mRNA enrichment protocol still retained some rRNAs, which were filtered out using SortMeRNA (Kopylova et al., 2012).This is an explorative study. We aim to explore what we can glean from the data.
