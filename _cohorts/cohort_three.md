    description: The EANBIT Bioinformatics program is a must do for anyone who is serious about research. I came out from school green and I was not sure of how to approach the job market. I was not sure of what to expect or what my interests were. But this program  offered mentors like Dr. Caleb and Festus Nyasimi who guided me to discover my interest. I have finally found  something that I am passionate about. The program enabled me to be able to draw a roadmap to my future.
I am not there yet but I am not where I was before joining the program and for this reason I am sincerely grateful to God for being chosen to go through it. Thank you EANBIT, ICIPE especially MBBU staff and my fellow interns for making my stay there memorable and for the skills that I have gained.

    description: The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) is a useful tool in valorising organic biomass and other biodegradable wastes. In this study, the BSF larvae were bred under different diets selected based on increasing lignocellulose content. These diets were: processed chicken feed (CF), chicken manure (CM), Brewerâ€™s spent grain (BSG), and Water Hyacinth (WH). An additional diet Feed Mix (FM), consisting of the four diets in equal proportions was also incorporated. The different metatranscriptomes were sequenced using the PCR-cDNA approach on the ONT MinION platform. While the work, using ONT, aimed to identify and functionally characterise lignocellulosic biomass-degrading microbes, the mRNA enrichment protocol still retained some rRNAs, which were filtered out using SortMeRNA (Kopylova et al., 2012).This is an explorative study. We aim to explore what we can glean from the data.
