    course: Bachelor of Science Applied Bioengineering
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: From October 2020 to January 2021 I attended the Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program hosted by the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Statistics Unit (MBBU) at icipe campus. The program afforded me a transformative experience where I was able to gain a deeper understanding on various topics I had challenges in, access a wide selection of resources, and improve my laboratory and programming skills in an effort to build my abilities towards my career in the future. The program was very flexible allowing interns to have access to learning materials for self- study and have sessions with a trainer, this made certain that I could focus on my weak areas as well as, it provided enough technical support which gave me exposure to the systems and made learning smoother. The collaborative nature of the program allowed me to interact with other interns from different discourse communities within the Bioinformatics field and this allowed me to learn and understand topics from theory to wet lab concepts and in a different way. My goals entering the program were fulfilled by the end of the 3 month experience, I gained skills in different programming languages for instance Linux and Python. In conclusion, this was quite an exploratory experience that was very engaging.

    course: Bachelors of science in Botany
    university: Pwani University
    description: The training, mentorship and networking I had during the Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program has improved my passion and skills for to move forward in searching for scholarship opportunities towards a Masters in Bioinformatics. This internship opportunity has played a key role in shaping my career development plan. It was a noble opportunity for mentorship and networking with people of similar interest in the bioinformatics field. I got to understand what is required of me to become a skilled Bioinformatician. The skills that I need to work on as per now and the various networks that are important for me to grow. The interaction with colleagues triggered and renewed my energy to soldier in pursuit of my career. The various activities organized such as journal club and weekly updates kept me on the move and changed my perception in life as well taught me the importance of self-organization in your day to day activities. I take his opportunity to thank our PI, Dr. Dan Masiga, Karen Wambui, Dr. Caleb Kibet, Mr. Festus Nyasimi and the MBBU staff who played key role in ensuring a smooth stay during the 4 months period, the combined effort has enabled me to achieve my goals as outlined in the roadmap at the beginning of the internship. I was able to acquire new skills that I wouldn’t have gained on my own without this opportunity that supported me to set right my priorities in the future.

    course: Bachelor of Science Molecular Biology
    university: Moi University
    description: I took part in the East African Network for Bioinformatics Training (EANBIT) and the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Statistics Unit (MBBU)-organized Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program from June to September 2021 at the icipe. The program provided me with a once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn more about a variety of topics I found challenging in genomics and bioinformatics, gained access to a wealth of resources, forged connections, and honed my programming and analysis skills in an effort to hone my abilities in anticipation of a future career in plant genomics. Because the program was very adaptable and permitted interns to access learning resources for independent study and participate in training sessions with  surpivisor and trainer Dr, caleb kibet Festus nyasimi respectively , I was able to focus on my weak areas.I was able to connect with other interns as well scientists from different discourse communities within the bioinformatics industry thanks to the program's collaborative nature, which helped me study and comprehend theoretical concepts in a fresh approach. By the end of the four-month experience, I had accomplished my objectives and improved my proficiency in several programming languages and bioinformatics genomic analysis. To sum it up, lemmi say, it was a really thorough and entertaining training.

    course: Bachelor of Science Biotechnology
    university: Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology
    description: My experience during the internship was educative, informative, life changing and great exposure into the computational world. Most of the skills and lessons learned were useful and very helpful for an upcoming scientist. The mode of learning was mainly hands-on and self-learning which I think is the best in raising the students’ curiosity, detail-oriented, make mistakes, work on them on the different ways or further consult. It was also a challenging experience, getting to know and interact with people that are way ahead in the computational field. This triggers your urge to proceed further, learn more and grow. My sincere gratitude to the organizers for choosing me to be part of the team. It was great experience and great exposure to young scientists. I now have a clearer picture of the career path I want to take, thanks to the exposure. It is also a great opportunity that I can recommend to young aspiring computational biologists. Special thanks to Dr. Caleb Kibet and Festus Nyasimi for their generous contribution and dedication towards the success of this course. Not to forget the master’s students and the entire MBBU team for their unending support.

    course: Bachelor of Science Biotechnology
    university: Kenyatta University
    description: This internship has been a life changing experience for me, the exposure of a research environment gave me the opportunity to understand some real world problems that are being solved in science. Interacting with successful scientists has motivated me to keep moving forward as a scientist, The mentorship program has been a great learning experience, the skills I have gained can attest to the expectations I had at the beginning, the tools and resources were up to date and easily accessible. The hands-free approach towards teaching has allowed me to work with High Performance computing (HPC), Programming, and Making use of Biological Databases and so on. I did a mini-project on RNA-seq data analysis in which I applied most of the above skills. Working on this project was an opportunity for me to obtain a hands-on experience in NGS data analysis. I would like to thank everyone who participated in creating this opportunity, it is a door to career growth for young scientists like me. I thank Dr. Caleb Kibet and Festus Nyasimi for their dedication in training and mentoring us.

  - name: Black Soldier Fly ribosomal RNA analysis
    description: The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) is a useful tool in valorising organic biomass and other biodegradable wastes. In this study, the BSF larvae were bred under different diets selected based on increasing lignocellulose content. These diets were: processed chicken feed (CF), chicken manure (CM), Brewer’s spent grain (BSG), and Water Hyacinth (WH). An additional diet Feed Mix (FM), consisting of the four diets in equal proportions was also incorporated. The different metatranscriptomes were sequenced using the PCR-cDNA approach on the ONT MinION platform. While the work, using ONT, aimed to identify and functionally characterise lignocellulosic biomass-degrading microbes, the mRNA enrichment protocol still retained some rRNAs, which were filtered out using SortMeRNA (Kopylova et al., 2012).This is an explorative study. We aim to explore what we can glean from the data.

  - name: RNA Seq Mini-Project
    description: RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) is a technique that can examine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Over the past few years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable tool for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential splicing of mRNAs. It is rapidly replacing gene expression microarrays in many labs as it lets you quantify, discover, and profile RNAs.
