    course: Bachelor of Science Applied Bioengineering
    university: The EANBIT Bioinformatics program is a must do for anyone who is serious about research. I came out from school green and I was not sure of how to approach the job market. I was not sure of what to expect or what my interests were. But this program  offered mentors like Dr. Caleb and Festus Nyasimi who guided me to discover my interest. I have finally found  something that I am passionate about. The program enabled me to be able to draw a roadmap to my future. I am not there yet but I am not where I was before joining the program and for this reason I am sincerely grateful to God for being chosen to go through it. Thank you EANBIT, ICIPE especially MBBU staff and my fellow interns for making my stay there memorable and for the skills that I have gained.

    description: I took part in the East African Network for Bioinformatics Training (EANBIT) and the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Statistics Unit (MBBU)-organized Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program from June to September 2021 at the icipe. The program provided me with a once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn more about a variety of topics I found challenging in genomics and bioinformatics, gained access to a wealth of resources, forged connections, and honed my programming and analysis skills in an effort to hone my abilities in anticipation of a future career in plant genomics. Because the program was very adaptable and permitted interns to access learning resources for independent study and participate in training sessions with  surpivisor and trainer Dr. Caleb Kibet, Festus Nyasimi respectively , I was able to focus on my weak areas.I was able to connect with other interns as well scientists from different discourse communities within the bioinformatics industry thanks to the program's collaborative nature, which helped me study and comprehend theoretical concepts in a fresh approach. By the end of the four-month experience, I had accomplished my objectives and improved my proficiency in several programming languages and bioinformatics genomic analysis. To sum it up, lemmi say, it was a really thorough and entertaining training.
    
projects:
  - name: Black Soldier fly ribosomal RNA analysis
    description: The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) is a useful tool in valorising organic biomass and other biodegradable wastes. In this study, the BSF larvae were bred under different diets selected based on increasing lignocellulose content. These diets were: processed chicken feed (CF), chicken manure (CM), Brewerâ€™s spent grain (BSG), and Water Hyacinth (WH). An additional diet Feed Mix (FM), consisting of the four diets in equal proportions was also incorporated. The different metatranscriptomes were sequenced using the PCR-cDNA approach on the ONT MinION platform. While the work, using ONT, aimed to identify and functionally characterise lignocellulosic biomass-degrading microbes, the mRNA enrichment protocol still retained some rRNAs, which were filtered out using SortMeRNA (Kopylova et al., 2012).This is an explorative study. We aim to explore what we can glean from the data.

  - name: Fungi identification
    description: This study aims at identifying fungi species present in the beehives across Madagascar, Zanzibar, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Kenya. You can find a better description of the project plan here. This will be using ITS2-4 data collected from these regions using metabarcoding.
