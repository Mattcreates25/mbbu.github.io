    course: Bachelor of Science Applied Bioengineering
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology
    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation program offered a well-detailed introduction to Bioinformatics. Interacting with successful scientists has motivated me to keep moving forward as a scientist. This program has been a great learning experience, the skills I have gained can attest to the expectations I had at the beginning, and the tools and resources are all up to date and easily accessible. The hands-free approach to teaching has allowed me to work within an HPC, understand some Programming languages, and Making use of Biological Databases, and so on. I have also learned how to communicate effectively, work in a team collaboratively, exchange ideas, and gain new insights from my supervisors and colleagues. I did a mini-project on the analysis of data Sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing Techniques in which I applied most of the above skills. Working on this project was an opportunity for me to obtain a hands-on experience in NGS data analysis. I would like to thank everyone who participated in creating this opportunity, it is a door to career growth for young scientists in the future and a wonderful program with no faults. I thank Dr. Caleb Kibet, Ruth Nanjala, Pauline Karega, and other trainers for their dedication to training and mentoring us.

    course: Bachelor of Science Botany
    university: Pwani University
    description: With a background in biology, I was exposed to the broad disciplines of plant and animal sciences which endowed me with theoretical understanding and practical skills in routine microbiology, genetics, and molecular biology. I consequently developed a passion for these fields and invested time in online courses on bioinformatics e.g., Introduction to Linux for Biologists (Future Learn), and Introduction to R among others, which made me apply for the Bioinformatics Internship and Incubation Program at ICIPE. The program is well structured offering a good mastery of concepts, personal and professional growth, hands-on experience through mini-projects, and scientific communication. Following the engagements during the internship, I have resolved to pursue a career utilizing genomic approaches to understand and conserve the environment and biodiversity. Many thanks to the organizers, trainers, and the MBBU at large.
    
projects:
  - name: Black soldier fly ribosomal RNA analysis
    description: The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens, BSF) is a useful tool in valorising organic biomass and other biodegradable wastes. In this study, the BSF larvae were bred under different diets selected based on increasing lignocellulose content. These diets were processed chicken feed (CF), chicken manure (CM), Brewerâ€™s spent grain (BSG), and Water Hyacinth (WH). An additional diet Feed Mix (FM), consisting of the four diets in equal proportions was also incorporated. The different metatranscriptomes were sequenced using the PCR-cDNA approach on the ONT MinION platform. While the work, using ONT, aimed to identify and functionally characterise lignocellulosic biomass-degrading microbes, the mRNA enrichment protocol still retained some rRNAs, which were filtered out using SortMeRNA (Kopylova et al., 2012).This is an explorative study. We aim to explore what we can glean from the data.
