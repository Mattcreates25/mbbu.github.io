    course: Bachelor of Science Applied Bioengineering
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology
    description: The EANBIT Bioinformatics program is a must do for anyone who is serious about research. I came out from school green and I was not sure of how to approach the job market. I was not sure of what to expect or what my interests were. But this program  offered mentors like Dr. Caleb and Festus Nyasimi who guided me to discover my interest. I have finally found  something that I am passionate about. The program enabled me to be able to draw a roadmap to my future. I am not there yet but I am not where I was before joining the program and for this reason I am sincerely grateful to God for being chosen to go through it. Thank you EANBIT, ICIPE especially MBBU staff and my fellow interns for making my stay there memorable and for the skills that I have gained.

    description: I took part in the East African Network for Bioinformatics Training (EANBIT) and the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Statistics Unit (MBBU)-organized Bioinformatics Incubation and Mentorship program from June to September 2021 at the icipe. The program provided me with a once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn more about a variety of topics I found challenging in genomics and bioinformatics, gained access to a wealth of resources, forged connections, and honed my programming and analysis skills in an effort to hone my abilities in anticipation of a future career in plant genomics. Because the program was very adaptable and permitted interns to access learning resources for independent study and participate in training sessions with  surpivisor and trainer Dr, caleb kibet Festus nyasimi respectively , I was able to focus on my weak areas.I was able to connect with other interns as well scientists from different discourse communities within the bioinformatics industry thanks to the program's collaborative nature, which helped me study and comprehend theoretical concepts in a fresh approach. By the end of the four-month experience, I had accomplished my objectives and improved my proficiency in several programming languages and bioinformatics genomic analysis. To sum it up, lemmi say, it was a really thorough and entertaining training.
 
projects:
  - name: 16s Mini-Project
    description: This project creates a workflow for 16SrRNA analysis for researchers.The 16S rRNA is a ribosomal RNA necessary for the synthesis of all prokaryotic proteins.

    participants:
      - Bryan Abuchery
      - Virginiah Kengara
  - name: RNA Seq Mini-Project
    description: RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) is a technique that can examine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Over the past few years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable tool for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential splicing of mRNAs. It is rapidly replacing gene expression microarrays in many labs as it lets you quantify, discover, and profile RNAs.
