    course: Bachelor of Science Applied Bioengineering
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology
    description: The Bioinformatics Incubation program offered a well-detailed introduction to Bioinformatics. Interacting with successful scientists has motivated me to keep moving forward as a scientist. This program has been a great learning experience, the skills I have gained can attest to the expectations I had at the beginning, and the tools and resources are all up to date and easily accessible. The hands-free approach to teaching has allowed me to work within an HPC, understand some Programming languages, and Making use of Biological Databases, and so on. I have also learned how to communicate effectively, work in a team collaboratively, exchange ideas, and gain new insights from my supervisors and colleagues. I did a mini-project on the analysis of data Sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing Techniques in which I applied most of the above skills. Working on this project was an opportunity for me to obtain a hands-on experience in NGS data analysis. I would like to thank everyone who participated in creating this opportunity, it is a door to career growth for young scientists in the future and a wonderful program with no faults. I thank Dr. Caleb Kibet, Ruth Nanjala, Pauline Karega, and other trainers for their dedication to training and mentoring us.

    course: Bachelor of Science Botany
    university: Pwani University
    description: With a background in biology, I was exposed to the broad disciplines of plant and animal sciences which endowed me with theoretical understanding and practical skills in routine microbiology, genetics, and molecular biology. I consequently developed a passion for these fields and invested time in online courses on bioinformatics e.g., Introduction to Linux for Biologists (Future Learn), and Introduction to R among others, which made me apply for the Bioinformatics Internship and Incubation Program at ICIPE. The program is well structured offering a good mastery of concepts, personal and professional growth, hands-on experience through mini-projects, and scientific communication. Following the engagements during the internship, I have resolved to pursue a career utilizing genomic approaches to understand and conserve the environment and biodiversity. Many thanks to the organizers, trainers, and the MBBU at large.
